Living is suffering. Every human being experiences some form of suffering at some point in their life. Suffering could
lead us to desperation and pain, but it is a great means to transform our reality.

## We have to feel it

In this world of stimulation and a sense of perfection, we will always be tempted to calm our pain by doing stupid
things such as posting on social media to pretend everything is okay, or even worse, drinking alcohol or using drugs.
But these are just temporary reliefs and will cause us even more problems.

The reality is that we have to deal with all the emotions we feel when we are suffering without any pleasant additives.
We will have to cry, speak, feel the emptiness, and question ourselves.

Now, you could be thinking, "Why in the world should I do this? I do not want any of this". Certainly, we do not, but
embracing the pain will give us more strength to deal with life, will provide us with more sense of awareness, and most
importantly, it will free us of many fears, giving us the power to try new things.

Yes, it will be challenging. But believe me, if we can deal with this, we will be able to do everything.

## Questioning ourselves

I will not lie. At first, we will question our mistakes. It is a good thing, but we cannot focus on that. We need to be
more reflexive and think that mistakes are lessons, something we will not repeat in the future if we face similar
circumstances, but that is enough. The past is unchangeable. Once we fully accept this, we can move forward to the next
steps with clarity and purpose.

Now that we have finally forgiven ourselves, is time to think about what we want to achieve. And this is the interesting
part, as pain can potentially show us that, perhaps, what we have been doing is not good for us, that is the opposite of
what we really want, or that we have been doing something for the wrong reasons. Magic!

## From questioning to action

Finally, is time to heal and bring peace to our suffering. What better way to do that than by pursuing our passions and
achieving the goals we have set for ourselves? In doing so, we prove not only to the world but, most importantly, to
ourselves that we are worthy of all the hard work and effort we will put in. This shift from questioning to action is
where true transformation happens. It is in our ability to turn pain into purpose that we unlock our full potential.

In the end, suffering is not something that holds us back but rather a driving force for growth. When we accept it, we
open the door to personal development, discovering strength where we once saw weakness and finding hope in places where
we once felt only despair.
