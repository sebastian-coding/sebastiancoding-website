As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, concerns about machines supplanting human roles have become
prevalent. However, several factors underscore the enduring value of human contributions in the workforce.

Get ready! It's time to start Decode!

## Costs of processing

Implementing comprehensive AI solutions entails significant expenses. The average cost of computing is expected to climb
**89% between 2023 and 2025**, with **70% of executives citing generative AI as a critical driver** of this increase.

Additionally, companies like **Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg charge up to $2 million annually** to access large,
proprietary datasets necessary for AI training.

These substantial costs can make full-scale AI adoption prohibitive for many organizations.

## The AI Monopoly

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is currently dominated by a few major corporations, leading to significant
centralization. For instance, in 2024, the United States commanded approximately
**86% of the North American AI market**, primarily due to the presence of tech giants such as **Amazon, Google,
Microsoft, and IBM**.

OpenAI, in particular, has emerged as a significant player in the AI landscape. As of 2024, OpenAI's valuation was
estimated at **$83 billion**, accounting for approximately **17% of the total AI industry valuation**.

This substantial market share underscores OpenAI's influence and the degree of centralization within the AI sector. A
significant disruption or policy change within any of these dominant firms could have **far-reaching impacts** on the
multitude of businesses and applications that rely on their AI services.

This concentration means that a substantial number of AI-powered products and services depend on the infrastructure and
platforms provided by these companies. While this centralization has facilitated rapid advancements and widespread
adoption of AI technologies, it also poses **potential risks**, such as:

- **Single points of failure**: If OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google experiences an outage, countless dependent applications
  could be disrupted.
- **Market stagnation**: Large AI monopolies may **stifle competition**, making it harder for smaller companies and
  startups to enter the industry.
- **High costs**: AI services provided by monopolistic firms may become increasingly expensive, limiting accessibility.

However, recent developments, such as the emergence of **DeepSeek**, demonstrate that **innovation can still disrupt the
status quo**. DeepSeek's AI Assistant quickly surpassed OpenAI’s ChatGPT to become the **top-rated free app on Apple’s
App Store in the US**, highlighting the potential for new entrants to challenge established players.

## The lack of human factor

AI, despite its advancements, lacks **genuine human creativity and emotional intelligence**. A study found that **people
more positively appraise human-created artworks**, associating them with **greater emotion,
story, and meaning**.

This suggests that human attributes like **empathy, intuition, and the ability to understand nuanced contexts remain
beyond AI's reach**. These uniquely human qualities are essential in fields that require **creativity, complex
decision-making, and interpersonal interactions**.

## AI as a tool

Rather than replacing human roles, AI should be seen as a **powerful tool** that enhances productivity, creativity, and
efficiency.

AI can automate repetitive tasks, analyze vast amounts of data, and assist in decision-making, but it lacks **human
intuition, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving abilities**. In many fields, AI serves as a
**collaborative assistant**, helping professionals **work smarter rather than replacing
them**.

Despite its capabilities, AI still requires **human oversight** to function effectively. It cannot **self-improve,
correct biases, or make ethical decisions** without guidance.

---

In conclusion, while AI offers significant advancements, **it is not poised to replace human roles entirely**. The
**high costs of implementation**, **potential risks of monopolistic control**, **absence of human creativity and
emotional understanding**, and the **opportunity to use AI as a complementary tool** all highlight the **enduring
necessity of human involvement** in the workforce.

That's it for today. Decode... dismissed!
